# Rack City

### Lets explore Rack!
Running this as an exploration into Rack and what drives some of the magic in Rails!
Hope to follow up with a web entry / blog documenting the steps. Until then, I will write the steps in a readme as I make them!

## Rack
``` bundle init ``` this adds a gemfile, and add your rack gem request there
``` ruby
 gem 'rack'
```
