# Rack City

### Lets explore Rack!
Running this as an exploration into Rack and what drives some of the magic in Rails!
Hope to follow up with a web entry / blog documenting the steps. Until then, I will write the steps in a readme as I make them!

## Rack
##### *this will be the bare-bones branch*
``` bundle init ``` this adds a gemfile, and add your rack gem request there
``` ruby
 gem 'rack'
```
From here run your ```bundle``` command and make your application, or checkout the bare-application branch and mess around.

## Basic App
##### *this will be the bare-application branch*
```touch rack_app.rb```
